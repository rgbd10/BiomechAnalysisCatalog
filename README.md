## Abstract

It is noticeable the increase in the use of Virtual and Augmented reality technologies for rehabilitation purposes. User studies in both areas recognize motion by comparing human joint positions to a pre-recorded movement, direction or position relative to a reference point. Most works do not follow the uniformity motion description provided by the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB), mainly due to the lack of ground truth reference information.

In this paper, we describe the process we carried out to perform the acquisition of representative biomechanical human poses captured using both Kinect V1 and V2. For the acquisition, we considered most critical movements performed by patients in rehabilitation programs, with varying speed and intensity. We also provide information on how to not perform the movements, i.e., how patients can mistakenly perform the sequences. From that point, we designed a methodology for evaluating biomechanical analysis algorithms. The entire dataset is freely available in the form of an open catalog meaning that submission of additional material is also accepted.
